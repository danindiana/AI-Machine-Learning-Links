Introduction to Ansible

Please bring a laptop for this hands-on introduction to Ansible.

In the course of this meetup you will each get to use Ansible to deploy Python code to a cluster of servers. We will use both playbooks (YAML files) and ad-hoc commands to accomplish this and other interesting things, like:

View recent logs from each server
Restart each server
Install a cron job on each server
Install python modules on each server

Ansible claims "Simple, agentless IT automation that anyone can use". I have used it on production gigs to deploy software on and generally troubleshoot a gaggle of raspberry pis. To me it's considerably simpler than either Puppet or Chef, and it has support for all the things I've needed: Install via apt, install via npm, copy files, create symlinks, read logs, restart servers, restart processes, set up cron jobs, etc.
